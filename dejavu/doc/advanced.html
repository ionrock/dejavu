<h2>Advanced Topics</h2>
<p>As with all frameworks, Dejavu can't cover every need out-of-the-box.
However, Dejavu has been specifically designed to be hackable. In particular,
the creation of new Storage Managers is a well-defined process. Read on if
there's a feature you need that you might consider building yourself.</p>

<h3>Subclassing Sandbox</h3>
<p>Okay, I lied. There's not much I can think of that you'd want to do with
Sandboxes. Most things I <i>can</i> think of would be better implemented
as Storage Manager middleware. But if you think of any, let me know.</p>

<h3>Store Hacking</h3>
<p>The most common modification to a <tt>StorageManager</tt> object is to
use it as a dumping-ground for other application data. Since the store
should persist for the lifetime of the application's process, it can serve
as a decent top-level Application namespace. Since the only mandatory
argument to <tt>Sandbox.__init__</tt> is a store, you can pass Sandboxes
around in your code and always have access to the root store. If you use
another application framework for your front-end, just stick a reference
to it in your store and vice-versa. Python dynamic attributes to the rescue
again!</p>

<h3>Passing through SQL</h3>
<p>If you <i>want</i> to keep writing SQL, there's nothing stopping you
from doing so. If nothing else, it can be a handy way to prototype or
migrate an application, and then replace the SQL with Dejavu API calls
later on. You'll need to make your deployers aware that you're using SQL
directly (and which DB's your SQL runs on), so they don't try to deploy
your application with an unsupported store.</p>

<p>To avoid stale data, you should probably flush any sandboxes before
running your query, especially if it updates data. You should also run
the following snippet to flush CachingProxy or BurnedProxy SM's:</p>

<pre>store.sweep_all()</pre>

<p>Then, use the extension methods built into StorageManager classes' "db"
attribute to get data:</p>

<pre>>>> rows, cols = s.db.fetch("SELECT djvFields.Value, Count(djvCity.ID) AS NumCities "
                            "FROM djvFields LEFT JOIN djvCity ON djvFields.ID = "
                            "djvCity.Field GROUP BY djvFields.Value")
>>> cols     # [(name, type), (name, type), ...]
[(u'Value', 202), (u'NumCities', 3)]
>>> rows
[(u'Baja California', 3), (u'Ciudad Juarez', 1), (u'Puerto Penasco', 0), (u'Yucatan Peninsula', 1)]
</pre>

<p>...or update:</p>

<pre>>>> s.db.execute("UPDATE djvFields SET ShortCode = Left(Value, 1) WHERE ShortCode Is Null;")</pre>

<p>There are a <b>lot</b> of other things you can do with the builtin
Database, Schema, Table, Column, and SQLDecompiler classes. Feel free to open
them up in an interactive session and explore. All of the RDBMS Storage Managers
are built on top of an independent SQL layer (called
<a href='http://projects.amor.org/geniusql'>Geniusql</a>) that knows nothing
about units or Storage Managers (but it does understand Expressions).</p>

<h3>Custom Storage Managers</h3>
<p>In most cases, you will add new functionality to Dejavu itself by
creating a custom Storage Manager, whether for a new backend, or a custom
middleware component. Storage Managers must conform to a simple interface
for creating, destroying, and recalling Units. They are free to implement
that functionality however they like.</p>

<p>As you can see in the code, the <tt>storage.StorageManager</tt> base
class requires you to override most of its methods.</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>__init__(self, allOptions={}):</tt> Optional.
        Place any startup code here, as each SM should only be instantiated
        once (at app startup). Any additional arguments should be passed
        in the allOptions dictionary (rather than modifying the signature).
        You should expect the keys and values of allOptions to be strings.
        </li>
    <li><tt>reserve(self, unit):</tt> Required. Take the supplied Unit
        instance and "make a space" for it in storage. The Unit does
        not need to be fully populated. If the Unit has an ID when
        passed to <tt>reserve</tt>, use it. If not, supply it using
        the class' UnitSequencer. If your database provides equivalent
        sequencing to dejavu Sequencers, feel free to use it. If not,
        grab all existing distinct ID's (which you are storing),
        and pass them to
        <tt>unit.sequencer.assign(unit, ids)</tt>, which should assign the
        next ID in the sequence to the Unit. Remember that when we say "ID"
        we mean a tuple of identifier (UnitProperty attribute) values.
        You should probably lock this whole method in a
        <tt>threading.Lock</tt>.</li>
    <li><tt>save(self, unit)</tt>: If <tt>not unit.dirty()</tt>, you can exit. Otherwise,
        iterate through the Unit's properties and persist each value,
        using an Adapter to coerce each value to the type expected by your
        database. If you are able to persist all values,
        call <tt>unit.cleanse()</tt> to mark the Unit as no longer dirty.
        You are not required to persist any Unit attributes other than
        UnitProperties.</li>
    <li><tt>destroy(self, unit):</tt> Required. Remove the Unit's data
        from storage permanently. For databases, this means
        <tt>"DELETE FROM %s WHERE %s;" %
        (table.qname, table.id_clause(**unit.properties))</tt>.</li>
    <li><tt>recall(self, unitClass, expr=None):</tt> Required.
        This method must return an iterable which yields fully-populated
        Unit objects. The Units must be of the supplied unitClass, and
        must match the Expression, if supplied. If an Expression is not
        supplied, all stored Units of the specified class must be returned.
        </li>
    <li><tt>create_storage(self, unitClass):</tt> Optional. If you do not
        override this method, it simply passes. If your Storage Manager
        needs to set up tables or other structures per unitClass (and
        almost all do at install time), use this method to do so.</li>
    <li><tt>shutdown(self):</tt> Optional. If you do not override this
        method, it simply passes. If your Storage Manager needs to be
        explicitly closed when the application shuts down, add code to
        do that here.</li>
    <li><tt>distinct(self, cls, fields, expr=None):</tt> Recommended.
        This method must return an iterable of (tuples of) distinct
        UnitProperty values for the given field(s). The Units from which
        the values are drawn must be of the supplied class (cls), and must
        match the Expression (expr), if supplied. If an Expression is not
        supplied, all stored Units of the specified class must be examined.
        </li>
    <li><tt>multirecall(self, classes, expr):</tt> Recommended.
        The 'classes' argument will be a UnitJoin and its children.
        This method must return an iterable of lists; each item in each list
        will be a Unit. The Units must be of the supplied classes, in order
        (see the UnitJoin.classes method), and must all match
        expr(*resultset) together.
        </li>
</ul>

<h4>Generic Database Wrappers</h4>
<p>Writing a Storage Manager for a database is relatively straightforward,
mostly because Dejavu doesn't have complicated storage interfaces or
demands. If you find your application depends heavily upon using advanced
features of a particular database, or upon hand-crafted SQL, then Dejavu
is not for you or your application. A Dejavu SM module for a database
usually includes:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Adapters, which coerce values from Python types to database types
        and back again. Base classes for DB Adapters can be found in
        <tt>dejavu.storage.db</tt>.</li>
    <li>An SQLDecompiler, which converts dejavu <tt>Expression</tt> objects
        (essentially, Python lambdas) into SQL.</li>
    <li>A subclass of <tt>geniusql.Database</tt>, which handles requests to
        SELECT data using the above two components, as well as ALTER TABLE,
        etc.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Adapters</h5>
<p>Generally, you will end up with three kinds of Adapters (subclasses of
<tt>storage.Adapter</tt>): one for converting Dejavu types to your database
types, another for the reverse (<tt>storage.db.AdapterFromDB</tt>), and
probably a third to insert Dejavu values (with proper quoting, etc.) into
SQL statements for your database (<tt>storage.db.AdapterToSQL</tt>).
The Adapter class provides a single public method, <tt>coerce(self, value, 
dbtype, pytype)</tt>, which takes any value and attempts to return a new
value.</p>

<p><tt>adapter.coerce()</tt> handles a request by calling a sibling method (that 
is, a method of the same subclass). Therefore, you need to add methods to
your Adapter for each Python type you wish to support. For example, if you
wish to coerce Python ints to INTEGER, you need to add the following method
to your Adapter subclass:
<pre>    def coerce_int_to_any(self, value):
        return str(value)</pre>
Methods are named <tt>coerce_type1_to_type2</tt>, where 'type1' and 'type2'
are type names, one of them a Python type and the other a database type.
If your type name has dots in it, they will be converted to underscores.
If either of the type names is 'any', that method will be used if no
more-specific coercion method exists. Again, you can most likely use
methods in the base Adapter classes provided.</p>

<p>Your coercion method should receive a single value and return that value,
coerced to a type. An outbound adapter coerces from Python types to database
types. You supply a Dejavu UnitProperty value to <tt>coerce</tt>, and the
appropriate coercion method will be selected based upon the <tt>type()</tt>
of that value. An inbound adapter, on the other hand, coerces from DB types
to Python types. Call <tt>coerce</tt> with your database value <i>and</i>
the <tt>valuetype</tt> argument, which is then used to call the appropriate
coercion method. That method returns the value, coerced to
<tt>type(valuetype)</tt>, which the UnitProperty expects.

<p>If <tt>coerce</tt> cannot find a method for the appropriate Python type,
it errors, and rightly so. Don't let these errors pass silently! An earlier
version of Dejavu had a "default" coercion method, which was a Bad Idea.
Don't replicate it.</p>

<h5>Decompiler</h5>
<p>The SQLDecompiler is the tricky bit of any Storage Manager. You must
receive a Unit class and an Expression, and produce valid SQL for your
database from both. For example, given:
<pre>unitClass = Things
expr = logic.Expression(lambda x: x.Group == 3)</pre>
...your decompiler should produce something like:
<pre>"SELECT * FROM [djvThings] WHERE [djvThings].[Group] = 3"</pre></p>

<p>The above example may seem trivial to you, but add in proper quoting,
diverse datatypes (like dates and decimals), complex operators (like 'in',
'Like', and 'ieq'), logic functions (like today() and iscurrentweek()),
null queries, and just-in-time keyword args, and it becomes complex very
quickly. You are, in effect, writing a mini-ORM.</p>

<p><b>But</b>, don't despair. Dejavu provides you with tools to make this
task easier:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The most important tool is <tt>geniusql.select.SQLDecompiler</tt>, a complete
        base class. You should be able to tweak it for most databases
        with a couple of SQL syntax changes.</li>
    <li><tt>SQLDecompiler</tt> is built on a simple Visitor-style base
        class, <tt>codewalk.LambdaDecompiler</tt>. More complicated
        extensions are easily added to this base class; each bytecode in
        the Expression (Python lambda) gets its own method call.</li>
    <li>You don't have to handle globals or cell references within the
        lambda--when the lambda gets wrapped in an Expression, all free
        variables are converted to constants.</li>
    <li>You aren't <i>forced</i> to handle every possible operator, function,
        or term in SQL. The base SQLDecompiler doesn't; when it encounters a
        function it can't handle, for example, it punts by flagging the SQL
        as <i>imperfect</i>. This signals the Storage Manager to run each
        Unit through the lambda (in pure Python) before yielding it back to
        the caller. In fact, you can start writing your Storage Manager
        without a decompiler at all! Just return all stored Units of the
        given class and use the Expression to filter whole Units. Then,
        when your SM works, add a decompiler.</li>
</ol>


<h5>Database/Table/IndexSet</h5>
<p>You'll need a subclass of <tt>geniusql.Database</tt>. Override the
container methods (like <tt>__setitem__</tt> and <tt>__delitem__</tt>).
For most popular databases, these are pretty straightforward. Some notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>select/where</b>: If no Expression is supplied, return all Units.
        Otherwise, use a decompiler to produce SQL which you can then use
        to grab Unit data from storage. Use each row to populate a Unit
        (use an Adapter for type coercion), and yield each Unit back to the
        caller. In general, it's faster to slurp all the data in at once
        than to make a separate call for each row.</li>
    <li><b>_get_tables/_columns/_indices</b>: use your database's
        schema-inspection tools to tell Dejavu the names, datatypes,
        and other metadata that actually exists in each deployed
        database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Database SM's should also define the methods <tt>create_database()</tt>
and <tt>drop_database()</tt>, if possible.</p>

<p>Use <tt>dejavu/test/zoo_fixture.py</tt> to test your new Storage
Manager. Copy one of the (<i>very</i> short) test_store* modules for the
other SM's, and make the necessary changes for your SM. All of the heavy
lifting of the tests is done in zoo_fixture.</p>

<h4>Legacy Database Wrappers</h4>
<p>Sometimes you do not have complete control over the database you want to
reference. In that case, you should probably still write a custom Storage
Manager, Adapters, and a Decompiler. Often, you can get away with providing
a simple column-to-Unit mapping to use as you decompile. I've built one, for
example, to wrap <a href='http://www.blackbaud.com/solutions/raisersedge.asp'>The
Raiser's Edge</a> (third-party fundraising software). My Dejavu model manages
directory records and income without regard for the underlying database;
a custom Storage Manager maps between that ideal model and the Raiser's
Edge API. This allows me to integrate data from RE with our custom
inventory, invoice, and scheduling software.</p>

<p>One of the more important parts of wrapping existing tables is getting
your pretty Python names mapped to ugly database names. Do this by making
a custom Database: override the <tt>_column_name</tt> and
<tt>table_name</tt> methods to do the mapping.</p>

<h4>Other Serialization Mechanisms</h4>
<h5>sockets</h5>
<p>There's a <tt>sockets</tt> module in the <tt>storage</tt> package.
It does simple serialization of Units across a socket, so you can run
Dejavu in its own process, separate from your front end. I had to do this
with a third-party database, which couldn't handle web-traffic threading
models. Here's a snippet of how to use it (from that app):
<pre>def query(self, cmd, unitType='', data=None):
    if isinstance(data, dejavu.Unit):
        data = stream(data)
    elif data is None:
        data = ''
    else:
        data = pickle.dumps(data)
    response = self.socket.query(":".join((cmd, unitType, data)))
    return response
</pre>
</p>
